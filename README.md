# Cluster-and-grid-computing
A supercomputer is a computer with a high level of performance as compared to a general-purpose computer. 
In this project we get to know the architectur of this computers by building a parallel systems that allow us to do Parallel computing.
## Arcitecturs
We used differents architecturs in this project :
shared memory, distributed memory and distributed file systems.
## Mandelbrot set
The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers {\displaystyle c}c for which the function {\displaystyle f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c}{\displaystyle $f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c}$ does not diverge when iterated from {\displaystyle z=0}z=0, i.e., for which the sequence {\displaystyle f_{c}(0)}{\displaystyle f_{c}(0)}, {\displaystyle f_{c}(f_{c}(0))}{\displaystyle f_{c}(f_{c}(0))}, etc., remains bounded in absolute value.
We used parallel computing to determine this set.
## code
The programme is written with C using differents librarys and apis (POSIX, OPENMP, MPI)
## report
The report presents all the work that we did in details (in french)
